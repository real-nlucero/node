Assuming you have Visual Studio and NodeJs already downloaded. I wanted to mention that within Visual Studio's you must setup the environment by downlaoding a few things.

Within Visual Studio's Terminal you can use this: 

npm install express mongoose body-parser cors nodemon
npm install nodemon -g      (might help in case of any unexpected error)


TEST:
nodemon     (to see if everthing is fine)


USE:
nodemon server.js     (to be able to use "http://localhost:4000/...")
